# Medical AI Prompter

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that integrates PDF extraction and interaction with a medical large language model (LLM) using the Replicate API. The notebook is designed to extract relevant information from medical research papers in PDF format and interact with the LLM to answer specific medical-related queries.

## Installation

To use this notebook, you need to install the required Python packages. You can install them by running the following commands:

```python
!pip install replicate
!pip install PyPDF2
```

2. **PDF Extraction**: The notebook extracts text from a PDF file specified by the user and processes it for further analysis.

3. **Interacting with the LLM**: The notebook provides a function to interact with the medical LLM to answer predefined questions based on the extracted text from the PDF.

4. **Chunking Text**: The extracted text is chunked to avoid exceeding the maximum input length for the LLM.

5. **Filling in Blanks**: The notebook includes a function to fill in answers to a predefined set of questions using the LLM.

6. **Interactive Queries**: Users can interact with the LLM by asking custom queries during the notebook execution.
